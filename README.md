# Trainer Trivia

This web application will allow users to master their Pokemon identification. The application is setup to allow authentication via GitHub at this time. Once in the game trainers will fall into the Trainer Lobby. Once the trainer is ready they will click on "ready" to commence the game. In the game, the trainer will be prompted with different hints to help identify the Pokemon. Trainers will earn points based on how quickly they choose the correct Pok√©mon.
